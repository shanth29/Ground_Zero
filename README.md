The main motto of this account is to share with beginners and to gain from experts. Here I will be posting all sort of programs which I will come across no matter easy or difficult. This collection of code will help an individual to prepare for their Interviews.
 
Everyone should feel free to post your suggestions so that we could come up with a better and efficient piece of code.

==> Requirements <==
 
   1. Laptop or Desktop with Linux Operating System.
   2. Good Internet Connection.
 
==> Software Installation <==
 
   1. Open terminal using (ctrl + alt + t) keys.
   2. Enter the following command to update your current packages.
                  
                   sudo apt-get update
 
   3. Use the following command to install the latest python version.
                  
                   sudo apt-get install python3
 
   4. Once done installing Python, install pip which is the Python package manager using the following command.
                  
                   sudo apt install python3-pip
 
==> Setup Virtual Environment<==
 
   1. Python has n number of packages with variations in version. The specific package is required for a specific
      project. Let’s see how to set up a virtual environment step-by-step. 
  
                   sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-venv
 
                   python3 -m venv <folder_name>
 
==> Once done with creating a virtual environment you can install required packages for your project using pip command.
   Now we have done with setting up Python software as well as a virtual environment on our machine.
 
==> Let’s Start Coding.
